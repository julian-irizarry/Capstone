paragraph=An Arduino library for the u-blox SARA-R5 LTE-M / NB-IoT modules with secure cloud, as used on the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17272">SparkFun MicroMod Asset Tracker</a> and the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18031">SparkFun LTE GNSS Breakout - SARA-R5</a>.<br/><br/>v1.1 has had a thorough update and includes new features and examples. This library now supports up to 7 simultaneous TCP or UDP sockets. There are new examples to show how to play ping pong with both TCP and UDP sockets.<br/><br/>v1.1 also supports binary data transfers correctly. There are new examples showing how you can integrate this library with the SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library, to use the SARA-R5 to: download AssistNow Online and Offline data and push it to the GNSS; open a connection to a NTRIP Caster (such as RTK2go, Skylark or Emlid Caster) and push RTK correction data to the GNSS.<br/>
